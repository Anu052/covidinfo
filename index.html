        <h1>Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</h1>
        <h3>COVID-19</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as COVID and the coronavirus, is a contagious disease
                caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was
                identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an
                ongoing pandemic.[8]

                Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing
                difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after
                exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable
                symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most
                (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms
                (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms
                (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of
                developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for
                months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to
                further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]

                COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles
                containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but
                they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed
                or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces.
                People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop
                symptoms.[17][18] </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[33][34] Common symptoms
                include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore
                throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[35] People with the same infection may have
                different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been
                identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a
                musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of
                digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[35] In people without prior ear, nose,
                and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[36]

            <h3>Prevention</h3>
            <h4>Face masks and respiratory hygiene</h4>
            <p>
                The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where
                there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to
                maintain.[163][164] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and
                pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social
                distancing.[164][165] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets
                dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[164][165] A face covering without vents or holes will
                also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of
                infection.[166] But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without
                having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any
                certification they can have. So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and
                are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage
                or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of
                the virus.[167]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h4>Hand-washing and hygiene</h4>
            <p>
                Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.[175] The WHO also recommends that
                individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to
                the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.[176] When soap
                and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60%
                alcohol.[177] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two
                formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol
                or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not
                an active substance for hand antisepsis." Glycerol is added as a humectant.[178]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h4>Social distancing</h4>
            <p>
                Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to
                slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include
                quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or
                shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel,
                avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[4]
                Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the
                outbreak.[179]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h4>Self-isolation</h4>
            <p>
                Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they
                have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[196]
                Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest
                self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[197] Those who may have been
                exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the
                widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible
                exposure.[198]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h4>Healthy diet and lifestyle</h4>
            <p>
                The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet, being physically active,
                managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep.[199]

                Consistently meeting scientific guidelines of 150+ minutes per week of exercise or similar physical
                activity was shown to be associated with a smaller risk of hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19,
                even when considering likely risk factors such as elevated BMI.[200][201]

                As of March 2021, there is no evidence that vitamin D status has any relationship with COVID-19 health
                outcomes.[202] The largest clinical trial on the subject, with over 6 000 participants and a dosage
                regime near the RDI, is set to conclude in July 2021.[203][204]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h4>International travel-related control measures</h4>
            <p>A 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related
                control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of
                COVID-19.[205] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive
                cases.[205] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many
                positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum
                10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and may be more effective if
                combined with an additional control measure like border screening.[205]</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h4>Mortality</h4>
            <p>
                Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[291] These numbers vary by region and over
                time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time
                since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[292]

                The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the
                population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well
                as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age,
                with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.[293][294][295]
                In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries’ populations. For
                example, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger
                population represents a larger percentage than in the US.[296]
